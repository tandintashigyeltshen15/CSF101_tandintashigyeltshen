Singly Linked List Implementation including Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Remove Nth Node From End of List

# Part 1: Singly Linked List Implementation
# Part 2: Reverse Linked List
# Part 3: Merge Two Sorted Lists
# Part 4: Remove Nth Node From End of List

# solution
# output:

Original List: 1 → 2 → 3
After Reversing: 3 → 2 → 1

List 1: 1 → 3 → 5
List 2: 2 → 4 → 6
Merged List: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6

Input List: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
After Removing 2nd Node from End: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5
