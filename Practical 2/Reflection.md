# Documentation
Main Concepts Applied
In this practical, I explored:
- Recursion and iterationthrough Fibonacci sequence generation.
- Algorithm design using pseudocode.
- Visual representation of logic through flowcharts.

These exercises helped me understand not just *how* to code a solution, but also *how to think* about the problem systematically.

# Reflection

# What I Learned
I learned how recursion repeatedly calls itself until it reaches a base case, and how iteration loops through steps until a condition is met.  
While recursion looks cleaner in code, iteration is usually faster and more memory-efficient.

Designing pseudocode and flowcharts for simple problems like finding the area of a rectangle or converting temperature helped me think more logically before coding. It also made me realize how important planning is when solving any programming task.

# Challenges and Solutions
At first, I struggled with *understanding how recursive functions stop. My program kept running indefinitely because I missed the base case (`n == 0` or `n == 1`). Once I understood that recursion must always have a stopping condition, it became clear.

I also made minor logic errors in pseudocode (like mixing assignment and comparison), but reviewing the flowchart helped me identify those mistakes before writing code.
