Question 1)

Create Flowcharts and Psuedocode for the following problems:
1) Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width
2) Determine if a number is even or odd.
4) Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Question 2) 

Create two different implementations of a Fibonacci number generator:
Recursive Implementation: Write a function that uses recursion (the function calls itself) to calculate
the nth Fibonacci number.
Iterative Implementation: Write a function that uses loops to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
without recursion.
Requirements:
• Both functions should take an integer n as input and return the nth Fibonacci number
• Comment your code to explain the logic
