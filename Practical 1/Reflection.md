3.Operators– Using different operators to perform mathematical and logical computations.
4.Control Structures– Implementing conditional statements and loops to control the flow of a program.
5.Functions and Scope– Creating modular code using functions and understanding how variables behave in different scopes.
6.File Operations– Reading and writing files for data storage and manipulation.

# Reflection

# What I Learned
Through these practicals, I learned how each programming concept builds upon the previous one.  
I became more comfortable writing clean and readable code, breaking problems into smaller functions, and understanding how data flows in a program.  
By the end, I could write small but complete programs that perform meaningful tasks like file reading, looping, and recursion.

# Challenges and Solutions
One of the challenges I faced was handling file paths during file operations — sometimes the file wouldn’t open because of incorrect directory references.  
I solved this by learning how to use relative paths(e.g., `./data/file.txt`) and checking the current working directory.

Another challenge was understanding recursionin the functions practical.  
Initially, I got stuck in infinite loops, but after visualizing the recursive calls step-by-step and using print statements, I understood how base and recursive cases work together.
